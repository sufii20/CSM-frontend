            the optional items, accessories and other articles offered/supplied
            with the motor vehicle at the time of delivery.

          <p>
            This PBO is subject to confirmation by the Company and shall only
            become effective thereafter.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Company may without notice make alterations to the design and
            construction specification of the Vehicle, and/or such alterations
            in the Vehicle as required by any Federal and/or Provincial
            legislation. The Company may without notice make amendments to the
            delivery schedule of the Vehicle and may alter the price of the
            Vehicle on account of government taxes and/or levies and/or currency
            fluctuations, or any other reason, such change being outside the
            reasonable control of the Company, which revisions in price shall be
            borne by the Applicant. The Company may also transfer this PBO to
            another Authorized Dealer without assigning any reason to the
            Applicant and the Vehicle may be supplied with or without such
            alterations and change through any Authorized Dealer.

          <p>
            The price(s) indicated/advertised are tentative Company prices
            inclusive of sales tax (excluding other levies and costs, government

          <p>
            The Applicant shall deposit with the Company an advance payment of
            Price in the form of a pay order, demand draft or crossed cheque in
            the name of the Company on account of the Applicant, within due date
            specified by the Authorized Dealer and/or the Company.
          </p>

          <p>
            The remaining amount of the Price shall be paid to the Company prior
            to the delivery date of the Vehicle. In case the Applicant fails to
            make payment of the remaining amount of the Price, the Company
            reserves the right to cancel the order and shall refund the amount
            paid by the Applicant, less an administrative charge equivalent to
            5% of the Price.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Price prevailing as at the time of delivery of the Vehicle will
            be the applicable Price to be paid by the Applicant.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Vehicle shall not be delivered to the Applicant until and unless
            the Company receives the entire payment of the Price. In the event
            that the Vehicle is ready to be delivered and the Applicant delays
            the payment of the remaining amount of the Price to the Company, or
            does not take delivery of the Vehicle, the Company will hold the
            Vehicle for fifteen (15) days after the delivery date of the Vehicle
            and thereafter deal with the Vehicle in the manner deemed fit by the
            Company. Any unforeseen damage suffered by the Vehicle during this
            period will be the sole responsibility of the Applicant.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Applicant wishes, at any time before the delivery of the
            Vehicle, to cancel the booking under the PBO, the Applicant may do
            so by making a written application (accompanied by the Applicant’s
            copy of the PBO in original) to the concerned Authorized Dealer, who
            will forward the same to the Company. The Company shall refund the
            amount paid by the Applicant, less an administrative charge
            equivalent to 5% of the Price, which net amount shall be paid to the
            Applicant through the concerned Authorized Dealer by means of a
            crossed cheque in the name of the Applicant within thirty (30) days
            of the date of receipt by the Company of the Applicant’s written
            application for cancellation of the PBO. The Company reserves the
            right to refuse any application for cancellation which is not
            accompanied by the Applicant’s copy of the PBO in original.

          <p>
            The Authorized Dealer and the Company shall make reasonable
            endeavors to deliver the Vehicle by the tentative delivery date, but
            shall not be responsible for any delays in the delivery of the
            Vehicle, including but not limited to, any delays occurring due to
            acts of God or enemy, change in government policies, labor strikes
            or civil commotion, injunctions granted by courts of law, or for any
            other reason beyond the reasonable control of either the Authorized
